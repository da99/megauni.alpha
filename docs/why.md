"I'm in the chat-room nearly non-stop these days, Fulk.
If you want a hand with anything, let me know.
Another issue is getting somebody to be in there full-time,
if the "op must be present" rule is going to be enforced.
Not all of us are on US time and there's been many a good
conversation ended because the room goes on mute when the last op needs to sleep."
