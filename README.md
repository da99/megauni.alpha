What's can you do with it?
-------------------------

*Express your life as a website.*

2-weeks:
  * Uni-Lang hosting.
    * Code examples.
    * mU customization, alterations
  * Court jester game/activity for your mU life(s).
    * Guide/suggestions
  * Publications: 
    * Early adopters -> impress friends -> college students -> everyone
    * Examples:

      * default functionality: magazine, hoots, etc.
      * masks
      * privacy
      * add-ons

Privately
---------
  
It's an omni-morph implemented as an Uni-Lang app with a default 
configuration for the user. 

Publicly: megaUni: Never get bored strategy.
Why: The Majority demands it.
How: Unlimited activities (aspects + timing) + uni-lang
Unlimited activities: like music/songs/shows/etc.
Everything becomes easy with: Computer system + libraries 

**Why was it so hard to come up with this program model?**
I was looking for a specific set of activities/apps
the Majority wanted. It turns out, The Majority does
not care as long as it is activities it involves friends.

Other thoughts: Let's forget about expanding
our ways of thinking. There are billions of people 
on this planet. Let's first make it easy for them to
express themselves as they want, then on the Internet
they can publish their thoughts and individuals can 
follow the path they want.

mU changes the world by increasing the demand for 
variety of architectures (aka thinking).
A higher demand for Kays, Wirths, Konrad Zuses, 
Slava Pestovs, Wallace Thornhills, Hans Hoppes, 
Bill Sardis, etc. 
Plus, the Majority shrinks in size.
My genius comes from my laziness and my desire for perfection.

Default Configuration
---------------------

* Lifes
* Friend-types: Best Friends, Acquaintances, Almost Strangers, Strangers
* Calendar
* Labels + News, Random, Encyclopedia, Q&A/Thanks/Fights, etc.
* Bored? 
  * The Majority like being told what to do within their frames of stimulation:
    * Make a friend happy: do this
    * Be polite: do this
    * Get Smarter: play this
* Reliability ratings: as friend, consumer, boss, etc.

Optional Configuration
----------------------

**Clubs:**
Why: 
* adds functionality. 
* abstraction to prevent mU awesomeness turning into user confusion.
* prevent spam

**Friends:**
Adds functionality through paid features.

**"I'm bored":**
Why: 
* timing.
How:
* friends + mU, scarcity, anticipation (timer)
