Inbox/uniChat/chat bots are the core functionality. All other functionality
is minor (ie non-prolonged activity). The user just wants to stay in 
chat as much as possible. Nothing else matters to The Majority.

Websites: Find new people to talk to. Record/search history. Find new things
  and events to write about. In other words: short bursts of activity. 
  In the end it ends up in uniChat as: "look what I made".
Life/school/work/charity/etc: something to talk about in uniChat.
uniChat:  the end goal of The Majority.

  * uniChat
  * Chat Bots: Activities until friends come online.
  * Outlandish Stranger-to-Stranger, special interest websites.
    * barter, collaboration, etc.
    * Reputation/Verification (super hero profile)
  * Websites for life: Expression/Personality, Status Symbols, Thank Yous
    * Chat bot tells friends to post stuff and entertain you.
    * Chat bot tells people about new websites: citys, bars, etc.
    * Website addons are bought through barter.
    * In other words: website as a
      collaborative locker, scrap book, timeline/archives, etc.
      The use changes as you change: business card, reputation, status symbol, etc.
      The main use will be as a blog/journal/g+ alternative. The novelty is:
      magazine vs. blog.
  * uni-lang

This gets mU 2 waves of early adopters: 
  * computation thinkers (designers + coders)
  * personal publishers
 

Short-term Success
------------------

Make it fun to create web apps for holding 20 **different**  conversations 
at the same time.

AJAX and HTML5 is more than enough to have fun with friends.
Specialized apps are used for media creation (graphics, audio, etc.) are
beyond the limitations of the browser. The main focus is on the
Mass Market: conversations + media sharing.

Long-term Success
----------------

Create *Uniac*: The Ultimate Computer System.
WYSIWYG, scalable from one CPU to Galactic Scale, 
Apps are obsolete, Factor/Pharo/etc.

This will provide the profits for R&D and takeover of 95% of the 
human market.  The remaining 5% is your competition/R&D.

*Keep adding features and complete mU.*
Don't focus on megaUNI itself. Only the content/activities.
Another wave, court jesters of circle of friends, then comes in.

*UniChat*
1) Text-based activities
2) NES 64 graphics
3) business services
4) Croquet version of megaUNI

Abstractions
-----------
      
* SpamGuard

      * defaults: mail, instant, main thread only
      
  * Labels
    * messages, people
    * savable filters
    
  * mail, message as logic+UI
    * labels/filters => folders
    * filter messages based on labeled people, labeled messages
    * comments => threaded comments => subscriptions
      * auto-labeling
      * auto-subscribe to tree section upon commenting

                  BOTS/pre-recorded conversations,
                  quizzes, surveys/compatibility tests, fan applications,
                  more-to-come
    visual: color schemes, templates, stream, lifes
    
* Chat
  * IRC + IM + Chat Rooms + Bots
  * Low Priority, High Time Preference
  * Low Priority, Low Time Pref.
  * High Priority, High Time Pref.
* Addons
* Lifes
  * Friend-types: Best Friends, Acquaintances, Almost Strangers, Strangers
* Chat Bots
  * The Majority like being told what to do within their frames of stimulation:
    * Make a friend happy: do this
    * Be polite: do this
    * Get Smarter: play this
    * rss/news feeds

Rules of the Social Universe:
-----------------------------

*1) It's not about "social". It's about talking, not learning.*
    Entertainment, not learning. Their minds are only entertained when
    they are talking to others. Preferably face-to-face.
  
*2) The Majority only cares about chat.*
    Look at their actions/inaction. Never trust their words.)
  
*3) Everything has to be integrated into chat.*
    Creates a false sense of face-to-face conversations.
  
*4) Anything done outside of chat is merely a temporary break from chat.*
    They run out of things to talk about.
  
*5) Anything done outside of chat is used as fodder for more chat.*
    People do stuff to talk about them later OR wait for friends to do something worth talking about.
    Examples: sports, video games, movies, etc.

Afraid?
------
  * Focus on easiest markets:
    * (100,000 * ($40 - $10)) per mo.
    * Easier markets are the most important:
       -> They make everything else EASY.
       -> Ever professional/manager/establishmentarian is connected to:
          students, family, relatives, friends
          -> If you captivate their connections, they have no excuse to go with you
             when you enter the tougher markets.
              
  *In other words: The Mass Market Rules The World. Who rules the Mass Market?*
      
    * tougher markets will use a mix of (high barrier of entry digital goods) + physical goods:
      white collar, blue collar, scientists, academic, other goods for easiest markets, etc.
      -> Products centered around: job/biz, productivity, customer interaction, dread/boredom, etc.
      -> EASY to take on when you have their friends/family/students captivated.
      -> EVERYONE wants to be connected to the Mass Market. It is 100% of the economy.
    
  * No advertising rev. Only retail sales. Bigger market than adventising, less costly profits.
    * Hosting
    * Paid limit expansion: websites and productivity apps (more profitable than advertising)
    * friend limits: pleases the students, punishes the adults
    * add-ons
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    *general idea*: as long as students are captivated,
      braindead morons will follow.
      Make it easy/convenient/intuitive to pay.
  
  * Everyone: 
    * Court jester game/activity for your mU life(s).
      * Guide/suggestions
    * Examples:
      * robot, baby, pet, human
    * Privacy: 4 masks 
    * me publising: 
      * friends as editors/contributors
      * addons: 
        * news, random, q&a, events/maps, magazine, hoots, etc.
        * surveys/questionnaires
        * montage backgrounds
        
Lack of Power (LivelyKernel, Brent Victor)
------------------------------------------

* Clipart: People do not want to make graphics. They want to consume them.
* Graphics: People who want to make graphics will already know how to use Illustrator, 
    Gimp, Photoshop, etc.
* Animations: Good for cutscenes, video.  
  You still have to code for interactivity. In other words: if you are creating a game,
  you are already working mostly in code.  Libraries and customization is good enough
  until you get the full Brent Victor experience.

* People will create tools on top of yours IF your environment is popular enough:
  e.g. WWW, Windows, etc.
  The market for editors is tiny. The market for consumption is huge. There is no need
  to worry about lack of graphics/animation editing. Focus on what the consumers want, 
  and the creatives/geniuses will follow.
  e.g. VPRI website
      
* 1) Most artists do not want want meta-tools, just tools.
  2) Artists go where the people are, despite difficulty of development (eg WWW, Windows, Java).
  3) mU/Uni-Lang is an extension of the WWW.  Therefore, people will use it.
  4) Code is still needed, even with the right abstractions, because there is always the need to
     improve upon the abstractions someone else has made for your profession. WYSIWYG is not enough.
     Code provides more precision.  It is easier to change code textual, than visually.
  5) Code + WYSIWYG is not enough. Voice/narration, layout, design, etc. They are all used properly
     by people with talent. People with talent are not afraid to write code or learn UI design.
     They are a minority, and will never be a majority.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In other words, demand/supply. Thefore, mU will still succeed just with Uni-Lang.

  Other reasons:
  1) Revenue/profits come from the Mass Market, not by selling tools, like Balsamiq.
  2) I have no skills for Kay/Ingall WYSIWYG.
  3) K/I WYSIWYG still requires a base language, like Uni-Lang. Any effort taken away from
     the language, would hurt both WYSIWYG and the language.  The language is far more important
     than WYSIWYG. It's better to make profits from Uni-Lang and then hire proper programmers
     for WYSIWYG. (Ideally, an alternative browser based on Squeak/Pharo/Factor environment.)

  4) WYSIYG in the browser: HTML4/5 + Flash, Illustrator/Fireworks/etc, etc. 
     This is the way it will be for the next 10 years or a WWW-alternative is
     developed. LivelyKernel is too esoteric and Squeak/Pharo is focused on education and
     business uses. They will not become into Mass Market.

Privately
---------
  
The easiest way to host/develop conversation-based AJAX/HTML5 apps.

Publicly: megaUni: Never get bored strategy.
Why: The Majority demands it.
How: Unlimited activities (aspects + timing) + uni-lang
Unlimited activities: like music/songs/shows/etc.
Everything becomes easy with: Computer system + libraries 

**Why was it so hard to come up with this program model?**
I was looking for a specific set of activities/apps
the Majority wanted. It turns out, The Majority does
not care as long as it is activities it involves friends.

Other thoughts: Let's forget about expanding
our ways of thinking. There are billions of people 
on this planet. Let's first make it easy for them to
express themselves as they want, then on the Internet
they can publish their thoughts and individuals can 
follow the path they want.

mU changes the world by increasing the demand for 
variety of architectures (aka thinking).
A higher demand for Kays, Wirths, Konrad Zuses, 
Slava Pestovs, Wallace Thornhills, Hans Hoppes, 
Bill Sardis, etc. 
Plus, the Majority shrinks in size.
My genius comes from my laziness and my desire for perfection.


Building Blocks of Activities
-----------------------------

  * publication, self-expression

      and not just at the water cooler.
  * learning 
    * City guides
            tips, warnings, humor/jokes, etc.
            hotels, air beds, rooms, etc.

  * judge / pundit
    * jesters, haikus, raps, "yo mama", story telling
    * judges/voting, coachs, fans, scouts (used in communities), cheerleaders, crew, teams & individuals
    * scarcity, forced to take turns being gladiator/judge/manager/crew/etc.
    
  * convenience <=> usage

Activities:
      * Photo Bingo: can't continue unless your other friends play.
      * Quiz Chain: Create 2 questions, pass it on. 

Elimination of all ads:
-----------------------

  Advertising is where middlemen make money by helping 
  producers of mediocre products sell on digital billboards on mediocre content.
  They pose no threat when you use: architecture, abstractions, automation, ind. design.
  The end result is saturation using high quality content, and making it hard to find mediocre content.

  * Search & Store/Mall -> saturation, apis, etc.
    * ad revenue
  * Factory automation + crazy simple maintenance + plant-based materials
  * humor-based products: e.g. Ph.D, Dilbert, etc.
  * instructional content/software/apps
  * Digital Products:
    Use content to generate ideas for digital products (games, activities, unibots, goods, etc.).
    Use instructional or humor or both aspects.
    Content becomes funnel to new games, activities, addons, etc.

  *Online "marketing" companies:*
    Get rid of them through: search, stores, saturation of free content.
    Internet service provider, computer provider: Adblock, defaults, etc.
    Saturation of publishing (blogs, etc) and communication sites and apps (instagram, tumblr, etc).
    Saturation of manufacturer (ie users of Doubleclick, Google ADs, etc)
  
  *Example: StackOverflow alternative w/o ads*
  1) Integrated + Related products: bug tracking, employee survey/collaboration
  2) Private (hosting, customization, official) and installable versions
  3) Charge for API/Integration access
  4) related products (factory)
  5) Charge for consulting, customization, finding employees/freelancer

  *Example: water cooler talk for professions: people post stories, anecdotes*
  1) Factory: humor, turn child into you, customize products w/fotos
  2) Focus on age/gender: sports, games/activities, biz/boss owner games, etc.
  3) Catalog: DVD, paper, online video
  4) Comics: Integrated ads/entertainment
  5) freelancer finder OR provide services
  6) instructional videos
  7) Turn profession into online game/activity for humor and instruction.
     - UniBot subscriptions, games/activities for humor/instruction

  *Example: Tech. Comics*
  1) bi-weekly, variety
  2) integrate ads with entertainment. occasionally instructional, funny videos
  3) search through archives, high-resolution images, charge for access, 
     search through labels or text.  give some away for free.
  4) Factory: t-shirts, books, calendares with ertain themes (bash, C, unilang, etc)
  5) Fodder for digital goods/activities/addons. Funnel audience.
  
  *Example: free blogs/websites*
  1) Related articles, books, products, unibots, games, etc.
  2) Pay to increase fan limit.
  3) Paid themes.
  4) Addons, activities, foto manipulation, etc.
  5) Submit article to club (w/ links to hotel deals, related content, etc.)
  6) Saturation to prevent competitors (eg Doubleclick, Google ads, content farms/mills.)

  *Example: freelance portal competitor*
  1) focus on PHP, C#, etc.
  2) offer intro. discounts to first customers.
  3) be 10% higher than elance.
  4) saturate market.
  5) charge higher prices than UniLang/higher end.

Advertising & Marketing
-----------------------

1) Don't talk to marketers. They are braindead + LOUDMOUTHS. 
   Impossible to understand the power and magic of ind. design.
   You give them 120%, they still want banner ads for an extra 1%.
2) Create products. More profitable than marketing them.
   ANY resource used for ads/marketing means it is one less for product
   creation.  In one hour, you can create 10 ideas. Ad/marketing does not 
   come close.
3) Marketers can only change perceptions. Ind. Designers can change the product.
   * Lousy at computational thinking & ind. design.
   * Marketing = mediocre profits = A/B testing
     Ind. design = superior profits
     20% vs 140%+
   * If they were creative, they would go out and 
     start their own companies/products.
4) Creating 10-20 products people want regularly, is different 
   than marketing 100 products few people want or already have.
5) A conglomerate is civilization. Marketing is desperation, the cesspool
   of mediocrity and limited POVs.
  
   megauni was created by someone tired of all marketing: 
     direct, guerilla, social media, etc.
   Talking to maketers/advertisers makes me less creative.
   They are toxic to me.

Anyone who does not love ind design and computational 
thinking is toxic.

Startup factory *&* bartering.  No equity, just automated competition.

Go after core business of buyer (of startup).
Provide technology for startup, regardless of owner of startup.
If you do accept equity, make a profit and get equity.
  * comparative/comparison shopping.
  * startups want to feel like they have an edge "compared to
    competitors"
  * discount on prices = equity in companies.
    * only in companies you do not plan on competting in.
    
Startups & Equity:
  * too long for pocket change. (mass market: faster, more profitable)
    * tied up in private stock.
    * 5+ years in payout
  * exception: won't compete in biz
  * exception: long-lasting company
  * exception: automated investments/equity
  * safety: $1 mil per mo. * mass markets -> $20 mil/mo.
  
Focus:
  * Building the computer that will take on The Internet.
  * barter for OSS contributions and take on The Big 5.
  * $1 bill/mo.: fiber/air, friend comm, biz comm, b2c comm,
    hobbies/topics/strangers, media ent., games, HTML5 games,
    fear
  

Startups & Big Companies
------------------------
*Mediocrity is like heroin:* it only takes one big hit
to get addicted. 
In other words: as long as people
believe they are making progress with their preferred methods,
they will continue to use them and avoid superior ideas.
Examples: 
Sony vs. Apple
HP vs Acer
MSFT vs everyone

Which is why it is easy to compete against 99.999% of the market.
Startups, Big Co.s, etc. They are all mediocre or incompetent.
Brainiac will let you captivate The Mass Market and all niches.
Superior Thinking combined with Brainiac will let you 
revolutionize EVERY single industry.  No industry has reached 
perfection.

Until Brainiac is built:
------------------------
  * high fees (income + prop. edge)
  * equity (startups + old comp.): Only in companies in an incubator, 
    if you avoid the situation of owing taxes on worthless fin. 
    instruments.
  * Still not worth it because even if you get 10 companies
    and each sells for $250 mill., you still could have gotten
    more using Brainiac.
  *Brainiac: lets you completely forget about "the one that got away".*

Mass Market:
------------
 * ( $1 -> $100 ) * mo.
 * Arch. + Automation + Saturation = BRAINIAC
 * Advertising, Startup/Old Comp, B2B, etc. 
   -> Chump Change, distraction, expensive,
      time consuming, legal, etc.
      because it involves angry people.
      Think of Std. Oil acquisitions.

  Focus on nothing but the Mass Market.
  Everything else gives you mediocre profits.
  The Mass Market ALWAYS gives you superior profits.
    Build your own products, don't market others.
    Build your own startups, give up on investing in others.
    Build your own companies with less than $1 mill.
      (Profitable within 6 mos.)
      No need to worry about "the one that got away"
        when you get 100x profit than what you put in.
