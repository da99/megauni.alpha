<div class="body">"Huge businesses like SAP are ridiculously wasteful. My friend works for Northrop Grumman and he knows several people who are completely terrible at their job and have been for many many years but they are still going strong at the company because the company believes (or maybe knows by fact?) that it's cheaper to keep a bad employee than risk a wrongful termination suit. Pretty unbelievable if you ask me."<br /><br />From: <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Comments/Benched.aspx?pg=3#312178">http://thedailywtf.com/Comments/Benched.aspx?pg=3#312178</a></div>

<div class="body">"...my pet peeve – the daily obsession with LeBron James. I am so sick of this constant obsession with LeBron James, a giant freak of nature who gets on his tippy toes to dunk a ball in a metal hoop. The hyper-obsession with that crap is a voluntary mental illness. Everywhere I go, that’s the only piece of news people want to discuss. As Jones also notes, the other great big piece of news is the life and times of Lindsay Lohan. A Google search of her name brings up in excess of 200 million listings."<br /><br />Read the rest: <a href="http://karendecoster.com/programmed-by-the-idiot-box.html">http://karendecoster.com/programmed-by-the-idiot-box.html</a></div>

          </h5>

<div class="body">"It's laughable to accuse James of narcissism when he turned down a chance to stay in Cleveland, where he'd be worshipped by locals and applauded by the press, to go to Miami, a less sports-driven market where he knows he’ll share the spotlight with two other players. That's pretty much the antithesis of narcissism.<br /><br />The press as a whole already hyped James’s decision without any prompting from him. Smartly, he decided to capitalize on the process for his own interests, agreeing to an exclusive ESPN special in exchange for a portion of the advertising revenue (which he donated to his preferred charity). Again, this was a fairly unremarkable business decision."<br /><br />Read the rest: <a href="http://blog.mises.org/13221/lebron-and-the-collectivist-mentality/">http://blog.mises.org/13221/lebron-and-the-collectivist-mentality/</a></div>
