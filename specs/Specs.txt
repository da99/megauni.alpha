Controller
* For all Newspaper-related controllers (e.g. NewspaperSection, etc.), the @newspaper
  must be retrieved despite being trashed.
* For all Newspaper-related controllers, the @newspaper must be non-trashed when 
  current member is a STRANGER_LEVEL. This mostly applies to :index actions that don't 
  require MEMBER_LEVEl.
* For all Newspaper-related controllers, the model instance (e.g. @article, @section, etc)
  can be retrieved if trashed, but only if level is at MEMBER_LEVEL.
