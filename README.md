What's can you do with it?
-------------------------

*You and your friends mess around with your life's website.*

2-week overnight success:
    
  * Focus on easiest markets:
    * students, IT, creative class, females 18-41, males 18-29
      -> (100,000 * ($40 - $10)) per mo.
      -> Entertainment centered around (friends, family, relatives, strangers/hobbies).
      -> Easier markets are the most important:
         -> They make everything else EASY.
         -> Ever professional/manager/establishmentarian is connected to:
            students, family, relatives, friends
            -> If you captivate their connections, they have no excuse to go with you
               when you enter the tougher markets.
              
  *In other words: The Mass Market Rules The World. Who rules the Mass Market?*
      
    * tougher markets will use a mix of (high barrier of entry digital goods) + physical goods:
      white collar, blue collar, scientists, academic, other goods for easiest markets, etc.
      -> Products centered around: job/biz, productivity, customer interaction, dread/boredom, etc.
      -> EASY to take on when you have their friends/family/students captivated.
      -> EVERYONE wants to be connected to the Mass Market. It is 100% of the economy.
    
  * No advertising rev. Only retail sales. Bigger market than adventising, less costly profits.
    * Hosting
    * Paid limit expansion: websites and productivity apps (more profitable than advertising)
    * friend limits: pleases the students, punishes the adults
    * add-ons
    ----------------------------------------------------------

      braindead morons will follow.
      Make it easy/convenient/intuitive to pay.

  * personal publishers
Another wave, court jesters of circle of friends, then comes in.
Keep adding features and complete mU.
 
Privately
---------
  
It's an omni-morph implemented as an Uni-Lang app with a default 
configuration for the user. 

Publicly: megaUni: Never get bored strategy.
Why: The Majority demands it.
How: Unlimited activities (aspects + timing) + uni-lang
Unlimited activities: like music/songs/shows/etc.
Everything becomes easy with: Computer system + libraries 

**Why was it so hard to come up with this program model?**
I was looking for a specific set of activities/apps
the Majority wanted. It turns out, The Majority does
not care as long as it is activities it involves friends.

Other thoughts: Let's forget about expanding
our ways of thinking. There are billions of people 
on this planet. Let's first make it easy for them to
express themselves as they want, then on the Internet
they can publish their thoughts and individuals can 
follow the path they want.

mU changes the world by increasing the demand for 
variety of architectures (aka thinking).
A higher demand for Kays, Wirths, Konrad Zuses, 
Slava Pestovs, Wallace Thornhills, Hans Hoppes, 
Bill Sardis, etc. 
Plus, the Majority shrinks in size.
My genius comes from my laziness and my desire for perfection.

Default Configuration
---------------------

* Lifes
* Friend-types: Best Friends, Acquaintances, Almost Strangers, Strangers
* Calendar
* Labels + News, Random, Encyclopedia, Q&A/Thanks/Fights, etc.
* Bored? 
  * The Majority like being told what to do within their frames of stimulation:
    * Make a friend happy: do this
    * Be polite: do this
    * Get Smarter: play this
* Reliability ratings: as friend, consumer, boss, etc.

Optional Configuration
----------------------

**Clubs:**
Why: 
* adds functionality. 
* abstraction to prevent mU awesomeness turning into user confusion.
* prevent spam

**Friends:**
Adds functionality through paid features.

**"I'm bored":**
Why: 
* timing.
How:
* friends + mU, scarcity, anticipation (timer)

Elimination of all ads:
-----------------------

  Advertising is where middlemen make money by helping 
  producers of mediocre products sell on digital billboards on mediocre content.
  They pose no threat when you use: architecture, abstractions, automation, ind. design.
  The end result is saturation using high quality content, and making it hard to find mediocre content.

  * Search & Store/Mall -> saturation, apis, etc.
    * ad revenue
  * Factory automation + crazy simple maintenance + plant-based materials
  * humor-based products: e.g. Ph.D, Dilbert, etc.
  * instructional content/software/apps
  * Digital Products:
    Use content to generate ideas for digital products (games, activities, unibots, goods, etc.).
    Use instructional or humor or both aspects.
    Content becomes funnel to new games, activities, addons, etc.

  *Online "marketing" companies:*
    Get rid of them through: search, stores, saturation of free content.
    Internet service provider, computer provider: Adblock, defaults, etc.
    Saturation of publishing (blogs, etc) and communication sites and apps (instagram, tumblr, etc).
    Saturation of manufacturer (ie users of Doubleclick, Google ADs, etc)
  
  *Example: StackOverflow alternative w/o ads*
  1) Integrated + Related products: bug tracking, employee survey/collaboration
  2) Private (hosting, customization, official) and installable versions
  3) Charge for API/Integration access
  4) related products (factory)
  5) Charge for consulting, customization, finding employees/freelancer

  *Example: water cooler talk for professions: people post stories, anecdotes*
  1) Factory: humor, turn child into you, customize products w/fotos
  2) Focus on age/gender: sports, games/activities, biz/boss owner games, etc.
  3) Catalog: DVD, paper, online video
  4) Comics: Integrated ads/entertainment
  5) freelancer finder OR provide services
  6) instructional videos
  7) Turn profession into online game/activity for humor and instruction.
     - UniBot subscriptions, games/activities for humor/instruction

  *Example: Tech. Comics*
  1) bi-weekly, variety
  2) integrate ads with entertainment. occasionally instructional, funny videos
  3) search through archives, high-resolution images, charge for access, 
     search through labels or text.  give some away for free.
  4) Factory: t-shirts, books, calendares with ertain themes (bash, C, unilang, etc)
  5) Fodder for digital goods/activities/addons. Funnel audience.
  
  *Example: free blogs/websites*
  1) Related articles, books, products, unibots, games, etc.
  2) Pay to increase fan limit.
  3) Paid themes.
  4) Addons, activities, foto manipulation, etc.
  5) Submit article to club (w/ links to hotel deals, related content, etc.)
  6) Saturation to prevent competitors (eg Doubleclick, Google ads, content farms/mills.)

  *Example: freelance portal competitor*
  1) focus on PHP, C#, etc.
  2) offer intro. discounts to first customers.
  3) be 10% higher than elance.
  4) saturate market.
  5) charge higher prices than UniLang/higher end.

Advertising & Marketing
-----------------------

1) Don't talk to marketers. They are braindead + LOUDMOUTHS. 
   Impossible to understand the power and magic of ind. design.
   You give them 120%, they still want banner ads for an extra 1%.
2) Create products. More profitable than marketing them.
   ANY resource used for ads/marketing means it is one less for product
   creation.  In one hour, you can create 10 ideas. Ad/marketing does not 
   come close.
3) Marketers can only change perceptions. Ind. Designers can change the product.
   * Lousy at computational thinking & ind. design.
   * Marketing = mediocre profits = A/B testing
     Ind. design = superior profits
     20% vs 140%+
   * If they were creative, they would go out and 
     start their own companies/products.
4) Creating 10-20 products people want regularly, is different 
   than marketing 100 products few people want or already have.
5) A conglomerate is civilization. Marketing is desperation, the cesspool
   of mediocrity and limited POVs.
  
   megauni was created by someone tired of all marketing: 
     direct, guerilla, social media, etc.
   Talking to maketers/advertisers makes me less creative.
   They are toxic to me.

Anyone who does not love ind design and computational 
thinking is toxic.

Startup factory *&* bartering.  No equity, just automated competition.

Go after core business of buyer (of startup).
Provide technology for startup, regardless of owner of startup.
If you do accept equity, make a profit and get equity.
  * comparative/comparison shopping.
  * startups want to feel like they have an edge "compared to
    competitors"
  * discount on prices = equity in companies.
    * only in companies you do not plan on competting in.
    
Startups & Equity:
  * too long for pocket change. (mass market: faster, more profitable)
    * tied up in private stock.
    * 5+ years in payout
  * exception: won't compete in biz
  * exception: long-lasting company
  * safety: $1 mil per mo. * mass markets -> $20 mil/mo.
  * barter for OSS contributions and take on The Big 5.
  
Focus:
  * Building the computer that will take on The Internet.
  * $1 bill/mo.: fiber/air, friend comm, biz comm, b2c comm,
    hobbies/topics/strangers, media ent., games, HTML5 games,
    fear
