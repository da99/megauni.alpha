The Storyteller (ie Producer) as a processing unit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure out all the possible ways to help The Storyteller profit and produce
stories/product.
 ->  Leads to more possibility production.
   -> More abstractions.
     -> Loop.
The Storyteller is a biological processing unit that considers various possibilities
(ie remixes). This leads to more remixs, abstractions -> Feedback Loop & Spiral Upwards.
Trying to use the Human Hive was too burdensome.  I could not organize and create a model,
so this is the next best thing.
