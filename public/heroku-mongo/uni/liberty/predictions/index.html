          <a href="/mess/4c658f9acb356d6148000004/">U.S. Checkmate: Consequences</a>
         </h5>

<div class="body">"If the US succeeds in this mission of militarizing Central Asia outwards from Afghanistan, it will have achieved a ‘checkmate’ -- in effect, blocking any combination of nations on earth from opposing the Pentagon agenda of Full Spectrum Dominance. The ability of the nations of South America -- from Venezuela to Bolivia to Cuba or Brazil -- to follow an economic and political course independent of the dictates of Washington will be dashed. The ability of China to build a regional Asian economic zone of stability independent of the collapsing dollar will be gone. Russia will be broken into feuding pieces as tribal and ethnic and religious wars spread across the states of the former Soviet Union in the manner of a new Thirty Years’ War. Hence the stakes for Washington in the seemingly remote events in Kyrgyzstan are of staggering geopolitical importance."<br /><br />- F.

         </h5>

<div class="body">"The story of MIT's program is getting out. They will have to argue that MIT's online curriculum is a fluke, that a normal university would not be wise in posting its lectures and course notes for the general public to view free of charge. Yes, MIT can do this, but it's different. It's different because. . . . Well, anyway, it's different. It's not fair to use it as a model. Why not? Because it's the best. The academic world knows it's the best. As an MIT T-shirt says: "Harvard: Because not Everyone Can Get into MIT." The best doesn't count."<br /><br />From: <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north874.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north874.html</a></div>

The "road to socialism"? No, already there. Fascism? Already there. But are we on the road to communism? You betchya!</div>

But that gross misallocation of capital is only part of the problem: since the vast overhang of luxury flats is illiquid and cannot be sold, these "investment properties as savings" are a black-hole capital trap: the invested capital cannot be turned back into cash.<br /><br />...panic will take hold, just as it does in the collapse of every bubble.</div>

         </h5>

<div class="body">Author Douglas Valentine: <br /><br />...the war will enter a bloodier phase reminiscent of the pacification of Iraq. As the CIA tightens its security measures, and as the Obama administration moves to reactivate some of the most brutal and corrupt warlords who fought the Soviets in the 1980s, the PRTs and their "community defense forces" will become increasingly reliant on criminals and sociopaths – agents who have no compunctions about pursuing unilateral CIA policies and goals that are antithetical to Afghanistan’s national interests. And that spells trouble for the CIA. The CIA is utterly predictable. As programmed, it will go on a killing spree until its vengeance is satisfied. But at the end of the day, the Afghan people will only hate the Americans more. And that spells defeat for the CIA and America.<br /><br />Read the rest: <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig11/valentine9.1.1.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig11/valentine9.1.1.html</a></div>

<div class="body">Economist Gary North: "young people who have come into the movement, who are not committed to Social Security and Medicare, and who would jolly well like it if those two programs were abolished, are the political hope of the nation. If these people become consistent in their opposition to welfare for the aged, we may convince them to become fanatical in their opposition to welfare for the young, namely, the public school system and tax supported education at the collegiate level. When individuals are willing to give up their own share of the loot, or their own age group's share of the loot, then I will begin to take seriously the Tea Party movement."<br /><br />From: <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north863.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north863.html</a></div>
