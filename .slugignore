# .slugignore
#  -- Ignore files for the final slug
#
#     The .slugignore file causes files to be
#     removed after you push code to Heroku and
#     before the buildpack runs. This lets you
#     prevent large files from being included in
#     the final slug.
#     Unlike .gitignore, .slugignore does not support negated ! patterns.
